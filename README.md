# YNABReporting

Using YNAB and the YNAB API to generate customised, monthly reports. After you entered all your transactions every month in YNAB, you can use YNABReporting to automatically send you a report via E-Mail at the end of each month. 

The report helps you understand your spending habits with clear numbers, and gives you a base for your budgets decisions for the following month.
